# MongoDB $inc operator error with string field

This example demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB. The `$inc` operator is designed to increment numeric fields, but attempting to use it on a string field will throw an error.

## Bug
The bug lies in the incorrect usage of the `$inc` operator with a string field. The following code snippet attempts to increment a string field:

```javascript
// Incorrect usage of $inc operator with a string field
db.collection.updateOne({ _id: 1 }, { $inc: { "stringField": 1 } });
```

This will result in an error, as `stringField` is not a number.

## Solution
To solve this, ensure that the field you are attempting to increment using `$inc` is of type number.  If you're dealing with existing data and need to convert fields, you may need to update the documents to convert string fields to numbers.

```javascript
// Correct usage of $inc operator
db.collection.updateOne({ _id: 1 }, { $inc: { "numberField": 1 } });
```
